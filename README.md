🎓 University Result Analysis System
📘 Project Overview

The University Result Analysis System is a Python-based data analysis project that automates the process of evaluating and visualizing student academic performance. It uses a real-world-like dataset named marksheet.csv containing student details such as Name, Gender, Age, Section, and marks in various subjects — Science, English, History, and Maths.

The main goal of this project is to simplify academic result processing by using Python automation and data visualization techniques. It provides teachers and administrators with clear insights into student performance, subject difficulty, and overall academic trends.

🧠 Key Features

✅ Calculates Total Marks, Percentage, Grades, and Ranks automatically

🏆 Identifies Subject-wise Toppers and Best Performing Subjects

📊 Performs Section-wise and Gender-wise performance analysis

📈 Generates Data Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

💾 Exports analyzed results to a CSV report file

🔍 Displays Correlation Heatmap to study relationships between subjects

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset marksheet.csv contains the following columns:

id – Unique ID for each student

Name – Student’s full name

Gender – Male or Female

Age – Student’s age

Section – Class section (A, B, C, etc.)

Science, English, History, Maths – Marks in each subject

Total entries: 250 students

📊 Visual Insights

The project generates visual reports such as:

Bar charts for section-wise performance

Gender comparison charts

Heatmap showing correlation between subjects

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add a web dashboard using Streamlit or Flask for live analytics

Include more subjects and flexible grading criteria

Integrate a database for storing multi-semester results

💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I improved my skills in data analysis, visualization, and Python automation. It also helped me understand how real-world datasets can be processed to make data-driven decisions in the education domain.
